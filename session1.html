        Maintain at least a 1-metre distance between yourself and others to reduce your risk of infection when they
        cough,sneeze or speak. Maintain an even greater distance between yourself and others when indoors. The further
        away,the better.<br><br>
        Make wearing a mask a normal part of being around other people. The appropriate use, storage and cleaning or
        disposal are essential to make masks as effective as possible.<br><br>
        <b>Here are the basics of how to wear a mask:</b><br><br>
        <b>Clean your hands before you put your mask on, as well as before and after you take it off, and after you
            touch it at any time.</b><br><br>
        <b>Make sure it covers both your nose, mouth and chin.</b><br><br>
        <b>When you take off a mask, store it in a clean plastic bag, and every day either wash it if it’s a fabric
            mask,
            or
            dispose of a medical mask in a trash bin.</b><br><br>
        <b>Don’t use masks with valves.</b>
